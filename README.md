Predicting chemical reactions with different representations of chemicals structures


There are 2 methods:
OpenNMT-tf and OpenNMT-py for different PC/GPU capabilities. 
OpenNMT-py requires PyTorch<=1.6.0, meaning max of CUDA version 10.2.
OpenNMT-tf requires TensorFlow 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, or 2.9, which gives broader CUDA compatability.
